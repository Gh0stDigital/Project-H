/**
 * Sound.
 *
 * Three problems make browser audio feel cursed, and each is designed out
 * here rather than worked around at the call site.
 *
 * 1. Latency. An <audio> element has a load pipeline and a play() that
 *    returns a promise, which puts 50-200 unpredictable milliseconds between
 *    a hit landing and the sound of it. So: decode once into an AudioBuffer,
 *    then start a fresh source node per play. That is sample-accurate, and a
 *    node is cheap enough to throw away every time — which is also what makes
 *    overlapping copies of one sound free, where an element could only ever
 *    play a sound once at a time.
 *
 * 2. Loading. Firing a cue whose buffer has not decoded yet is the other half
 *    of the same bug. Here it is simply silent: play() checks and returns.
 *    Nothing in this file throws, and nothing the game does is ever awaited on
 *    audio — a sound that is missing, slow or broken must never be able to
 *    interrupt a battle.
 *
 * 3. Autoplay. The context starts suspended and needs a real gesture; older
 *    iOS also wants a silent buffer played once before it will co-operate.
 *    unlock() does both, and music asked for before then is remembered and
 *    started when it lands, so the caller never has to know.
 *
 * And one that is specific to this game: it runs offline from file://, where
 * fetch() is blocked. The usual recipe — fetch the url, decode the response —
 * therefore works when hosted and is silent on the phone. Decoding straight
 * from base64 avoids the network layer entirely, so both builds take one path.
